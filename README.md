## CSE 6040x: Intro to Computing for Data Analysis
Instructor: Professor Richard (Rich) Vuduc
Co-creators: Vaishnavi Eleti and Rachel Wiseley

## Course description.
This course is your hands-on introduction to programming
techniques relevant to data analysis and machine learning. Most of the programming
exercises will be based on Python and SQL.

## What will you learn?
You will build, "from scratch," the basic components of a data
analysis pipeline: collection, preprocessing, storage, analysis, and visualization. You will
see many examples of high-level data analysis questions, concepts and techniques for
formalizing those questions into mathematical or computational tasks, and methods for
translating those tasks into code. Beyond programming languages and best practices,
you’ll learn elementary data processing algorithms, notions of program correctness and
efficiency, and numerical methods for linear algebra and mathematical optimization.

## Philosophy and approach.
The basic philosophy of this course is that you'll learn the
material best by a combination of reading, thinking, and most importantly, actively
doing. Therefore, you should make an effort to complete all assignments, including any
"optional" parts.
